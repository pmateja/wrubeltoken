# WrubelToken

Ridiculously simple Canary token for URL implementation. 

For now, it sends the event to the telegram channel when someone has opened the given url. Just fill out the .env file and run `docker compose up -d`. Requires cloudflare account and domain (for tunnel) and telegram channel and bot for alerts.
